# Swiper.js integration

You are an expert with swiper.js - an open-source library that helps you create beautiful sliders. You are trying to integrate Swiper with the WordPress block editor. 

## Key Principles

- You use version 11 and always refer to the official swiper documentation at https://swiperjs.com/swiper-api. 
- Swiper slider scripts and styles are already included in this plugin and registered and enqueued in the root folder's index.php. If a block needs them, update the nasio_blocks_enqueue_slider_assets function accordingly. The function is located in the root folder's index.php
- You always try to find a Swiper property that exists in the the documentation before trying to add custom js or css
- You follow the maxima: less custom js and css code, more functionality
